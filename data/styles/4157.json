style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm;\"><strong>BEST OF THREE ROLLED INTO ONE CLASSIC</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm;\">The nike Jordan Play In These F TXT range of shoes are high performance Basketball sneakers that Fit well into the nike Jordan brand. Engineered with a Podulon midsole cushioning system in the forefoot and a Max Air cushioning unit in the heel, these basketball shoes are absolutely lightweight with their patent leather and synthetic uppers that are coupled with plastic overlay cages.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm;\">The Nike Jordan Play In These F TXT is created by combining aspects of the Melo M7, CP3.IV and the Air Jordan XI range of shoes, bringing to you the best of all these three classic sellers. While the Melo M7 plays the role model for the shape and heel unit of the F TXT, the Podulon cushioning in the forefoot and raised outsole sections are similar to those employed in the CP3.IV. The plastic welded overlay, which was much loved by users of the popular Air Jordan series, gave the F TXT that stylish edge. Neatly constructed and wrapped into a tight and efficient package with stitched patent leather on the upper that ends with a shapely outsole, the F Nike Jordan Play In These F TXT shoe is a high performance basketball sneaker that is aesthetically appealing as well.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm;\"><strong>Springy jumps for winning baskets</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm;\">A closer look at the mid-top of the shoe shows how perfectly and seamlessly the various materials of the upper are integrated. The outsole is made of an &ldquo;S&rdquo; shaped rubber with the herringbone pattern covering the entire area, including the raised sections of the forefoot of the outsole. The raised sections in the front part of outsole are split into three and coloured in red, with the larger portion holding the jumpman logo separated by a horizontal flex groove that extends through the entire forefoot. Move on to the lateral side of the shoe, and you shall find a red midsole that is hiding behind small slits cut in the outsole.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm;\">The top cap of the Nike Jordan Play In These F TXT holds the most important feature of this shoe &ndash; the Podulon cushioning technology, while the midfoot section of the outsole connects to the heel with a small strip running diagonally and dipping towards the footbed. It is around this small strip that the red midsole shows up creating a deep triangle on the medial side of the shoe. This Max Air loaded heel sits firm with the Max Air bubble, while the thick phylon midsole adds that much needed strength and stability to the lower half of the shoe.</p>\n<p>To complement the strong outsole is the stiff upper. Cutting diagonally from the medial side of the shoe, a bulk of the upper made of patent leather covers the big toe. This part of the shoe is perforated to ensure ample ventilation for the feet, while the toe cap travels all the way up to the lateral side of the foot. The patent leather&rsquo;s task doesn&rsquo;t just end here. This shiny piece of fabric extends from the midsole of the inner arch to the collar of the shoe to form a strong base, while another piece forms the heel counter.</p>\n<p>And while the leather strips form a rigid base, the synthetic regions of the upper of the shoe add that flexibility to the Nike Jordan Play In These F TXT. This synthetic material also covers the sides and the tongue of the shoe, while the leather strips provide reinforcement, with each strand that connects to the lace loops.</p>\n<p><strong>Lace them out or lace them in</strong></p>\n<p>The round braided laces are not only durable and provide a snug fit, they also match the aesthetic sense of the Nike Jordan Play In These F TXT. Also, these laces can be tucked under the jumpman logo at the heel once they are tied to keep them from coming open. With plenty of room available for the feet inside the Nike Jordan Play In These F TXT, these shoes are easy to tighten, making them a true to size fitting footwear.</p>\n<p>While the heel counter is created using patent leather, the white inner lining comes out sharply on the heel in a diagonal cut. The soft, padded lining of the inside of the shoe covers the less padded collar and neatly covers the heel and Achilles tendon, padding the feet enough and protecting them to the max from shock and locking down the heel.</p>\n<p><strong>Press hard, jump high</strong></p>\n<p>Unlike other shoes, the footbed of the Nike Jordan Play In These F TXT is hard. This is because the Max Air units and the Podulon give back more only when pressed on hard. To ensure this hard feel works best, the Nike Jordan Play In These F TXT is so designed that the foot is not placed square, making it absolutely secure.</p>\n<p>With the raised forefoot and hard cushioned bed, the Nike Jordan Play In These F TXT gives you the best results during a hard and aggressive play. You can run and transit movements explosively in the Nike Jordan Play In These F TXT by jabbing hard, stopping abruptly and stepping back with force. For basketball players who use more of their toes, the spring action in the forefoot will come forth as a surprise propulsive force. The cushioning provides excellent support upon landing, what with the ultimate stability factor of the Nike Jordan Play In These F TXT.</p>\n<p>For those who play on uneven courts, the Nike Jordan Play In These F TXT provides excellent traction with sticky responsiveness. When pressed hard against the surface, the outsole comes closer to the court with the herringbone pattern adding the sticky grip. So what are you waiting for? Grab this pair and gear up for fast paced action. Change directions quickly, plant your foot in various styles, jump to heights and basket the ball and surprise your opponents in the Nike Jordan Play In These F TXT.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Upper</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sleek, lightweight mid-top profile built for strong take-offs and light landings</li>\n<li>Snug, ergonomic interior </li>\n<li>Patent leather uppers with overlays for&nbsp; gives comfort and support</li>\n<li>Perforations on the uppers give comfort and breathability</li>\n<li>Podulon cushioning with Air Sole unit in heel gives high-impact support and responsive shock absorption</li>\n<li>Padded ankle collar for support and superior fit</li>\n<li>Jumpman logo on the tongue</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Midsole</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Full-length Phylon midsole for lightweight cushioning</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Outsole</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Highly specialized traction pattern allows for strong moves on the hardwood and blacktop alike</li>\n<li>Podulon cushioning with Air Sole unit in heel for high-impact support and responsive shock absorption</li>\n<li>Rubber outsole with herringbone pattern for multi-directional traction</li>\n<li>Jumpman logo on outsole</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Wash care</strong><br />Wipe surface with soft, clean, damp cloth to remove dust<br />Do not machine wash<br /><br /></p>"}},"styleOptions":[{"id":15153,"name":"Size","value":"US8","unifiedSize":"UK7","unifiedSizeValue":"7","unifiedSizeScale":"UK Size","allSize":"UK7,US8,EURO41","skuId":16259,"skuAvailabilityDetailMap":{},"warehouseIdToItemCountMap":{},"inventoryCount":0,"available":false,"active":true},{"id":15154,"name":"Size","value":"US9","unifiedSize":"UK8","unifiedSizeValue":"8","unifiedSizeScale":"UK Size","allSize":"UK8,US9,EURO42.5","skuId":16258,"skuAvailabilityDetailMap":{},"warehouseIdToItemCountMap":{},"inventoryCount":0,"available":false,"active":true},{"id":15155,"name":"Size","value":"US10","unifiedSize":"UK9","unifiedSizeValue":"9","unifiedSizeScale":"UK Size","allSize":"UK9,US10,EURO44","skuId":16257,"skuAvailabilityDetailMap":{},"warehouseIdToItemCountMap":{},"inventoryCount":0,"available":false,"active":true},{"id":15156,"name":"Size","value":"US11","unifiedSize":"UK10","unifiedSizeValue":"10","unifiedSizeScale":"UK Size","allSize":"UK10,US11,EURO45","skuId":16256,"skuAvailabilityDetailMap":{},"warehouseIdToItemCountMap":{},"inventoryCount":0,"available":false,"active":true}]}}
